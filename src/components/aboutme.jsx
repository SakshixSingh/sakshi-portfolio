            Hi, Iâ€™m Sakshi! Iâ€™m currently studying Electrical and Computer Engineering, 
            where I get to explore both the hardware and software side of technology.<br /><br />
            I enjoy designing and building projects that are both functional and 
            visually appealing. My interests include <strong>UI/UX</strong>, 
            <strong> web development</strong>, and continuously improving my 
            <strong> problem-solving skills</strong> through DSA.<br /><br />
            Outside of academics, I like doodling and working on creative ideas â€” 
            it helps me keep a balance between logic and creativity.<br /><br />
            â€” <span className="signature">Sakshi</span>
